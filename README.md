## Core Concepts

* You must override `hashCode()` in every class that overrides `equals()`. Failure to do so will result in a violation of the general contract for `Object.hashCode()`, which will prevent your class from functioning properly in conjunction with all hash-based collections, including `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and `Hashtable`. - __Effective Java, by Joshua Bloch__ 

## Miscellaneous

* Filtering even and odd numbers
* Minimum and maximum element of integer the array
* Remove duplicate elements from list
* Reverse a string
* Fizz and Buzz
* Nested parentheses
* One away
* String basic compression

## Immutable

 * with mutable object

## Comparable & Comparator

* Sort user-defined object using `Comparator`

## Collection

* Navigable Map

## Design Pattern

* Dependency Injection

### Creational

* Factory Pattern
* Abstract Factory Pattern
* Singleton
* Builder

## Multi-threading

* Read multiple files using `Thread`
* Consumer-Producer `Thread`
* Dining Philosopher

## Network & REST

* Weather API
  
## Algorithm
